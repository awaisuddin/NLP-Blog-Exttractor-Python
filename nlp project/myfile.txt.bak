Other APIs include local APIs  mobile APIs  and machine-to-machine (M2M) APIs  but we’ll be focusing on web APIs for now. In the same way that an endpoint is the URL of an API  resources are the data you request from API URLs. Other APIs have stricter usage guidelines and may require users to submit certain information before accessing the provider’s features and functions.
SQL vs NoSQL: Choosing a database for your next project , Overview of SQL and NoSQL databasesSQL (structured query language) databases are relational  meaning that data is organized into tables with rows and columns. For example  if you’re tracking customers and orders in a SQL database  you can use a foreign key to link each customer to their respective orders. Oracle Database is an example of a multi-model database management system  which supports relational databases in addition to other data models. In a NoSQL database  you don’t need to define the relationships between different pieces of data; instead  you simply store all the information in a single document. It’s worth noting that there are different types of NoSQL databases  each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

How to become a programmer without a degree , Why a computer science degree is not the right choice for everybodySince every programmer is inherently a learner  the most expensive and time-consuming learning option is not necessarily the optimal option for every future programmer out there. University tuition in the United States has been on the rise[1] for the past few decades  with no sign of slowing down. Even with available scholarships and loans  pursuing a traditional bachelor’s degree (let alone a more advanced degree) is a costly and debt-inducing venture for a lot of students. Suppose you’re reskilling from another profession  learning part-time with family obligations  or need to work part-time while learning to become a programmer. Online learning provides a great option for eager students who have always felt more comfortable learning outside of the classroom setting.

What is data engineering? , Data engineering in the 20th and 21st centuriesBill Inmon defined data engineering as “the construction of a system that converts data into information” in his 1993 textbook  “Building the Data Warehouse.” Inmon’s definition of data engineering is still pretty accurate today. Data engineering really only started coming into its own in the late 20th century  with the rise of big data and distributed data architectures. The rise of distributed data architecturesBig data is a term that refers to the massive  ever-growing volume of data that organizations are generating. In the early days of data engineering  the focus was on building data warehouses — large  centralized repositories for storing data that could be used for reporting and analysis. The centralized data warehouse model eventually gave way to the distributed data architecture of today  where data is stored in multiple  distributed locations.

How to think like a programmer: 3 misconceptions debunked , If you aren’t a self-proclaimed math nerd or computer geek  you might assume that you could never learn to code. The truth is that while becoming a proficient programmer takes a lot of work  anyone can learn the basics  and there are a lot of benefits to doing so. You shouldn’t be discouraged by misconceptions about programming that frame it as an activity that’s reserved for a talented few. Programmers come from diverse backgrounds and bring a wide range of skills to their work—they’re not all STEM experts. Today  we’ll talk about some common misconceptions about programming and why you shouldn’t let them dissuade you from learning to code.
How much math do you need to know to be a developer? , Math used in everyday software developmentYou may have heard people claim that you don’t need to be good at math to succeed as a developer. Certain roles within the software development field require a higher level of mathematical understanding than others. For example  a role such as a machine learning engineer will require a greater understanding of mathematical concepts than a web developer.

The top 6 system design interview mistakes to avoid , Virtually all systems have bottlenecks  and all system designs are capable of having some kind of fault or vulnerability that can lead to total system failure. Alright  “total system” failure might be a touch dramatic  but it’s meant to underscore the importance of knowing your system’s weaknesses. If you find that your system design could fail under intense loads  then ask your interviewer what the intended load for this system is before thinking of ways to make your system more scalable. Every system design has strengths and weaknesses. When you practice solving system design problems  try walking yourself or someone else through your solution.
Compiled vs interpreted language: Basics for beginning devs , This problem led to a valuable invention: assembly language. Assembly language is a kind of shorthand or mnemonic device (to generalize) that directly correlates to binary code. Hence the vacuum-tube programmer’s job was replaced by the assembler  a computer program holding a set of instructions determined by hardware architects to translate assembly language to machine language. Unfortunately for programmers of the time  writing anything but the most basic program in assembly language still proved not only difficult but time-consuming. Thankfully  most modern computers come with assemblers built-in  so they won’t need translation down to the machine language (binary code) level.

Performance testing 101: Finding and fixing bottlenecks , The performance testing processPerformance testing methodologies can vary depending on your specific needs  but for the most part  they tend to follow the same basic steps. Step 1: Identify your testing environmentIdeally  you’ll want to be able to choose an appropriate performance testing tool and testing environment. There isn’t an industry-standard definition of what good performance entails  so you’ll have to base your goals around what good performance would look like from the perspective of your end-users. In general  you do want to make sure that the number of application tiers in your performance testing environment is identical to the live tier deployment model. You want to run a pilot test to check and see if your performance test can measure the targeted KPIs.
6 characteristics that can make you an outstanding developer , 6 characteristics that can make you an outstanding developer1. You’re a builderIt’s fascinating to learn how things work.

But today  we’ll be taking a look at two popular resources that can make JS programming easier and help us develop interactive web applications: Angular and React. We’ll briefly introduce JS  then compare these two tools at a high level.
Software architecture diagramming and patterns , What is software architecture? Software architecture describes the fundamental concepts and properties of a system within the context of its environment  relationships  principles of design  and more. Software architecture encompasses the organization of a software system  structural elements  behavioral elements  and the composition of those elements into larger subsystems. Choosing the right architecture for your software will lead to stabler performance under stressful conditions as you scale up. Similarly  thorough software architecture can help your engineers quickly locate and fix bugs.
Scalable Systems 101 , You could be dealing with a monolithic database  where one database is responsible for handling all of the data requests for every server node. There are only so many requests a single database can respond to at a time. One way to make sure your database is scalable is to make wise use of database partitioning and sharding. Choosing the wrong software architecture can make adding new features difficult and maintenance costly  and it may shorten a software system’s lifespan considerably. Caches intercept all database requests before they hit the origin servers.
What is Polymorphism in Python? , Polymorphism is the principle that one kind of thing can take a variety of forms. In the context of programming  this means that a single entity in a programming language can behave in multiple ways depending on the context. Examples of polymorphism in PythonPolymorphism is a basic condition of Python  and it affects how the language works at multiple levels. Today  we’ll focus on the polymorphism of operators  functions  and class methods in Python. Operator PolymorphismOperator polymorphism  or operator overloading  means that one symbol can be used to perform multiple operations.
5 reasons you should use C++ for digital signal processing , C++ uses dynamic memory management which means we must manually indicate where that memory is stored and also how it is removed. When memory management is automatic instead of dynamic  the process takes up more memory and CPU power. Memory management in C++ allows for optimization for even larger scale applications. The process of converting from floating point to fixed point can often lead to errors and be time-consuming. However  C++ has features that allow us to simplify the process of converting from floating points to fixed points.
Learn to code for social good: My philosophy as an artist & dev , I certainly meandered a bit before learning to code. In fact  I was pursuing a career in modeling before deciding to become a full-stack web developer in 2017. Embrace the plot twistsFor my undergraduate studies  I attended the Philosophy department at the University of Washington. I’d been pursuing a modeling career since I was 18. The idea to learn to code was actually planted in my head by a non-profit organization created by philanthropist and supermodel Karlie Kloss.

Web scraping with Python: A quick guide , For this tutorial  we’ll build a web scraper to help us compare the average prices of products offered by two similar online fashion retailers. Step 1: Select the URLs you want to scrapeFor both Madewell and NET-A-PORTER  you’ll want to grab the target URL from their webpage for women’s jeans. We want to narrow down our target when data scraping  and we can get more specific by using attributes inside of the <span> tag instead. Here’s a quick breakdown of why we chose these web scraping tools:SeleniumSelenium can automatically open a web browser and run tasks in it using a simple script. Scrapy is another Python library that would have been suitable for this task  but it’s a little more complex than BS4.
MongoDB vs DynamoDB: Which NoSQL database is right for you? , First released in 2012  DynamoDB supports two types of NoSQL data: key-value and document-oriented. It has similar functionality to MongoDB  though it is only usable through Amazon Web Services (AWS)  making it less than ideal for users who aren’t working with AWS services. DynamoDB  however  uses AWS to manage updates  scaling  and availability  making the setup process quick and simple. Its querying capabilities aren’t great  and it only allows three data types for primary keys: string  number  and binary. (It does support many different data types for other attributes within a table.)
Flask vs Django: Which Python framework is right for you? , Differences between Flask and DjangoAs mentioned  Django is a multitasking and sophisticated counterpart to Flask. In a Flask vs Django fight  Flask would be well out of its weight class. The Flask framework is ideal for small projects  whereas Django is ideal for a project with plenty of web apps. Flask uses roughly 29 000 lines  whereas Django has just about 290 000 lines of code. This can threaten the site’s safety with the inclusion of third-party modules  meaning the added software was written by neither you nor the Python developers.
3 philosophies that influenced software development , I started my undergraduate studies by pursuing a double major in philosophy and mathematics. A philosophy is a way of thinking that determines how we understand ourselves  the world  or the right thing to do. Much like a program  a philosophy is composed of a set of premises and principles that determine how we handle events. Whether or not we’re aware of it  there’s a philosophy driving everything we do – from the way we honor history  to the way we develop software. Today we’ll discuss three philosophies that have influenced software development  in ways big and small.

I’m a developer. Is software engineering management right for me? , Some devs are happy remaining as individual contributors and progressing in their careers that way rather than transitioning into a management role. As an individual contributor  typically you’ll get to focus on getting your priorities done in order (unless your manager says otherwise). In general  there seems to be less context switching in an individual contributor role than a management role  but it really depends on your company  org  team  etc. An individual contributor will typically take responsibility for solutions and designs. Beyond this  in a management role  you must feel comfortable acting as a leader  mentor  guide  and teacher to a group of people.
What are the differences between C# and Java? , C# and Java: A brief historyOrigins of C#C# was first developed in 2000 as a direct competitor to Java by Anders Hejlsberg and his team at Microsoft. Like Java  C# was based on the C and C++ programming languages  referenced by its original name  “C.O.O.L. ” or “C-like Object Oriented Language ” but was designed with business and enterprise needs in mind. In 2005  version 2.0 of C# introduced features generics and iterators to catch up to Java. Though the first few versions of C# shared many similarities with C++ and Java  later releases helped distinguish C# as a unique language capable of facilitating object-oriented and functional programming. Origins of JavaJames Gosling began the development of Java at Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle) as an alternative to the C++ programming language  with its first public implementation in 1995.

Is C++ an object-oriented programming language? , What is object-oriented programming? Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on classes and objects and four OOP concepts of inheritance  encapsulation  abstraction  and polymorphism. OOP is modeled off the fact that the real world consists of objects  rather than the variables and functions we use in software development. In OOP  each object has properties and functions that it can perform. Objects that share properties and functions can be grouped into classes and subclasses  which serve as blueprints for the properties and functions that an object will inherit.

System design fundamentals: What is the CAP theorem? , When deciding which NoSQL database to use  it’s important to keep the CAP theorem in mind. NoSQL databases can be classified based on the two CAP features they support:CA databasesCA databases enable consistency and availability across all nodes. The CP system is structured so that there’s only one primary node that receives all of the write requests in a given replica set. Secondary nodes replicate the data in the primary nodes  so if the primary node fails  a secondary node can stand-in. It’s a NoSQL database with no primary node  meaning that all of the nodes remain available.
10 common mistakes Python programmers make (and how to fix them) , Exhausting iteratorsIt is important for early Python developers to understand that both iterators and generators can be exhausted. Developers who are transitioning from Python2 to Python3 might especially encounter this issue. This is because you have exhausted the iterator and it has no remaining values to return. You can fix this by simply converting a function to a list from the get-go. Check out this resource for more details on iterators in Python.

5 things I wish I'd known about Git , If like me  you use git commit -am "checkin message" to commit your work  then the second “adding/staging” state is more or less invisible to you. It’s for this reason that I encourage new users to drop the -a flag and git add by hand  so that they understand these distinctions. One subtlety is that the -a flag doesn’t add new files to the content tracked by git – it just adds changes made. From this comes another key point: all git repositories are created equal. This is another key difference between git and more traditional (nay  obsolete) client/server models of content history management.
3 Features beginner devs overlook when building APIs , Well  I’m simply unable to count the number of APIs I’ve seen which will happily return an HTTP status code of 200 and some unclear error message in the response body. However  there are corner cases in which you might not want to include detailed error messages due to privacy or security concerns. Another best practice is to ensure that you’re consistent in your error message format. If your message is text  it is alright to return only text. Take your time to design an error response model which can be parsed by the client and you can consistently use it across your system.

Spring Architecture and ComponentsLet’s break down the fundamental pieces of a Spring Framework application to help you see the big picture. Spring manages all the dependencies of an object and instantiates the object into a bean after injecting the required dependencies. Spring identifies a selected bean’s dependency  looks for a match  and then populates the dependency.
Code refresh: Knocking the rust off of tenured directors , Typically these career journeys see a reduction in technical skills but the ambition and intellectual stimulation required to become promoted becomes more demanding. Skills that have high complexity due to more underlying components will have a higher rate of declination. Additionally  skills with a lower frequency of practice will also show signs of higher rates of declination. Coding holds a high level of complexity that compounds with the general trend of lower frequency of practice amongst directors. As a result  technical skills are at increased risk of becoming dull over time compared to most other skills.
Bytesize: 3 future uses of Blockchain , While it’s the best solution we have right now  it still creates a barrier between the voter and the voting system. That’s why some experts are excited about Blockchain to enable online voting. The idea is to distribute a unique voting “coin” to all registered voters. Blockchain’s encrypted  decentralized nature makes these votes hard to hack and manipulate  which is the main obstacle against online voting. While still too early to implement at scale  Blockchain technology appears to be our current best option to enable online voting and further increase the availability of electoral engagement.
What are Java Collections? Get started with the framework , Collections are used in every programming language. Before the Collections Framework  it was hard for programmers to write algorithms that worked for different kinds of collections. Java came with some Collection classes  like Vector  Stack  Hashtable  and Array  but they had their disadvantages. In JDK 1.2  Java developers introduced the Collections Framework  which is an important framework to help you achieve all of your data operations. Today  we’ll dive deeper into this framework and some of its components.
Data science in 5 minutes: What is data cleaning? , Data cleaning  or data cleansing  is the important process of correcting or removing incorrect  incomplete  or duplicate data within a dataset. Data cleaning differs from data transformation because you’re actually removing data that doesn’t belong in your dataset. With data transformation  you’re changing your data to a different format or structure. Data transformation processes are sometimes referred to as data wrangling or data munging. The data cleaning process is what we’ll focus on today.
React tutorial: How to build the Instagram UI with React , Create UI componentsNow we can start customizing the template to look like the Instagram UI. Header componentWe need to make the components folder in the src/ directory of our application to hold our Header component. To make it visually appealing  we’ll have to create a CSS style sheet in our Header component directory. // src/components/Header/index.js import React from "react"; import "./Header.css"; class Header extends React.Component{ render(){ return ( <nav className="Nav"> <div className="Nav-menus"> <div className="Nav-brand"> <a className="Nav-brand-logo" href="/"> Instagram </a> </div> </div> </nav> ); } } export default Header;We’re now ready to render our component and see how it looks. Simply replace the code in your src/App.js file with the following code:// src.App.js import React  { Component } from 'react'; import './App.css'; import Header from './components/Header'; class App extends Component { render() { return ( <Header /> ); } } export default App;This essentially tells the app to display the Header as a regular feature of the page.

They may not have intended it  but that one system failure in 2008 managed to lead developers down a whole new path of testing.
What is JavaScript map? Get started in 5 minutes , What is JavaScript map? Any value (objects and primitives) can be used as a key or a value. JavaScript Map creates a new array  which contains the results from the iteration over the elements of the array and calls the provided function once for each element in order. Note: WeakMap is similar to Map   but all keys in a WeakMap are objects. To create a new Map   follow this syntax:let map = new Map([iterable]);Let’s say we want to create one that stores names as keys and scores as values.
The weakest link: Scaling up your team , As you look towards building your team up to scale with your business  you may run into the issue of a weak link team.

S.O.L.I.D. Principles of Object-Oriented Programming in C# , In other words  each should have full responsibility for a single functionality of the program. Here the “reason” is that we want to change the single functionality this class pursues. If we do not want this single functionality to change  we will never change this class because all components of the class should relate to that behavior. It is easy to hide data from the user when all data and methods for a job are within the same single-responsibility class. If you add a getter and setter method to a single-responsibility class  the class meets all criteria of an encapsulated class.

What is functional programming? Explained in Python  JS  and Java , Variables and functionsThe core building blocks of a functional program are variables and functions rather than objects and methods. Functional programming approaches generally avoid shared state functions (multiple functions relying on the same state) and mutating state functions (function relies on a mutable function) because they make programs less modular. RecursionOne major difference between object-oriented programming and functional programming is that functional programs avoid constructions like If-Else statements or loops that can create different outputs on each execution. Functional programs use recursion in place of loops for all iteration tasks. First-class functionsFunctions in functional programming are treated as a data type and can be used like any other value.

SASS Best Practices: 9 frontend tips for CSS preprocessors , Variables in SASSUsing variables in CSS is not necessarily anything new. Using SASS takes out the guesswork and will compile all variables down to something that can be read by a browser engine. Instead of the var() syntax of CSS  SASS uses the same syntax as it did to assign the variable value. This works very well when we have a design system and want to keep colors  heading sizes and font-families consistent. This takes away the purpose of what using variables in CSS or SASS means.
Applied Data Science: serverless functions  pipelines and PySpark , How to create an echo function in AWS LambdaAn echo function is a simple AWS function that returns the content of the trigger event sent to the program.

Data Structures 101: introducing graphs in JavaScript , In an undirected graph  the edges are bi-directional by default; for example  with the pair (0 1)  it means there exists an edge between vertex 0 and 1 without any specific direction. Say we wanted to calculate the maximum possible edges for an undirected graph. The maximum possible edges of a graph with n vertices will be all possible pairs of vertices. There are C ( n   2 ) C(n 2) C(n 2) possible pairs of vertices  according to Combinatorics. Solving by binomial coefficients gives us n ( n − 1 ) 2 \frac{n(n-1)}{2} 2n(n−1)​  so there are n ( n − 1 ) 2 \frac{n(n-1)}{2} 2n(n−1)​ ​​ maximum possible edges in an undirected graph.

Dynamic Programming Tutorial: making efficient programs in Python , If you’re learning Python  it can be hard to take that step from writing sample code to efficient code. One way to get more efficiency out of your recursive programs is to start using dynamic programming  a time-saving storage-based technique  in place of brute force recursion. Dynamic programming uses the principle of optimality  which is the idea that if all steps of a process are optimized  then the result is also optimized. In our case  the optimal step is the one which takes the least amount of time which in programming means it takes the fewest new computations. To help you jump into efficient Python code  here’s a quick tutorial on what dynamic programming is  why it’s more efficient  and how to use it to solve common interview problems.

Data structures 101: How to use linked lists in Java , Some important applications of Linked Lists include:Implementing HashMaps  File System and Adjacency ListsDynamic memory allocation: use linked lists of free blocksPerforming arithmetic operations on long integersMaintaining a directory of namesTypes of linked listsSince a linked list is a linear data structure  meaning that the elements are not stored at contiguous locations  it’s necessary to have different types of linked lists to access and modify our elements accordingly. There are a three different types of linked lists that serve different purposes for organizing our code. Singly linked list (Uni-directional)A singly linked list is unidirectional  meaning that it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Some common operations for singly linked lists are:Doubly linked list (Bi-directional)Doubly linked lists (DLLs) are an extension of basic linked lists  but they contain a pointer to the next node as well as the previous node. A single linked list and double linked list can be made into a circular linked list.

A complete guide to web development in Python , A web framework is a collection of packages and modules made up of pre-written  standardized code that supports the development of web applications  making development faster and easier  and your programs more reliable and scalable. Python web frameworks are only utilized in the backend for server-side technology  aiding in URL routing  HTTP requests and responses  accessing databases  and web security. While it is not required to use a web framework  it is extremely recommended because it helps you develop complex applications in significantly less time. What are some popular Python web frameworks? Django and Flask are  by a wide margin  the most popular Python web development frameworksDjango is a Python web framework that offers an open-source  high-level framework that “encourages rapid development and clean  pragmatic design.” It’s fast  secure  and scalable.
What is object-oriented programming? OOP explained in depth , Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript  C++  Java  and Python. These functions are defined within the class and perform some action helpful to that specific type of object. For example  our Car class may have a method repaint that changes the color attribute of our car. This function is only helpful to objects of type Car   so we declare it within the Car class thus making it a method.

Hybrid apps work as both web apps and native mobile apps.
Understanding and Using Prototypical Inheritance in JavaScript , Important terms__proto__ propertyIn Javascript  every object has its own hidden  internal property  [[Prototype]] . JavaScript objects must be linked to this prototype object. If an object is created without the using a constructor function  it will have a constructor property. The constructor property will return a reference to the object’s Object constructor function. Object B’s [[Prototype] ] property points to prototype object A.
50 Python interview questions and answers , Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function  this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling. Question 11: Explain inheritance in Python with an exampleInheritance allows one class to gain all the members(say attributes and methods) of another class. The class from which we are inheriting is called super-class and the class that is inherited is called a derived / child class. The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and xrange returns an xrange object.
Acing the JavaScript Interview: top questions explained , How to prepare for JavaScript interviewsCoding interviews are notoriously rigorous  and many candidates feel stumped on how to prepare.

A tutorial on modern multithreading and concurrency in C++ , For example  a data race is a common issue you may encounter in C++ concurrency and multi-threaded processes. History of C++ concurrencyC++11 was the first C++ standard to introduce concurrency  including threads  the C++ memory model  conditional variables  mutex  and more. Concurrency vs. parallelismConcurrency and parallelism often get mixed up  but it’s important to understand the difference. In parallelism  we run multiple copies of the same program simultaneously  but they are executed on different data. As we explained above  concurrent programming involves a shared memory location  and the different threads actually “read” the information provided by the previous threads.
Behavioral interviews: How to prepare and ace interview questions , Why do behavioral interviews matter? Acing the technical interview is obviously important  but the behavioral interview is just as critical if you want to stand out as a desirable candidate. Behavioral interviews are a vital determining factor. It’s a common misconception in the tech world that soft skills are less important than technical skills. Behavioral interviews matter just as much as your coding interviews  so  it’s time to prepare!

Sidra explained that women in Pakistan prefer not to work late  either for safety concerns or responsibilities at home. This respects the lives of our female Developer Advocates and the work they do for the company.
10 tips for managing time estimations on coding projects , To Summarize: Get involved with the time estimation process by tracking and charting your work and estimates. You will come to better understand each other’s work process and styles  which will ease the collaborative and managerial operations. So  when you are managing time estimations  this distinction will clarify your expectations and expectations of others. In other words  a team  company  or worker must track a repository of time estimations from previous projects. Consider the people involved  the time of year (work ethic is impacted by holidays  school schedules  weather  etc)  overarching goals  the scope of the work  task complexity  skill levels etc.
Why a FAANG company may not be right for you , Let’s examine five notable reasons why a FAANG company may not be right for you. Projects at FAANG companies may require less creative engagementCompared to a smaller or start-up company  the day-to-day operations at a FAANG company are far more solidified. Getting a job with a FAANG company can feel like a rigged system that favors those with specific qualifications or titles. FAANG companies will not necessarily outlast smaller tech companies; no industry is immune to collapse or reconfiguration. The perception that FAANG companies are inherently more reliable than smaller companies is not necessarily the case.
5 tried and true techniques to prepare for a coding interview , At most companies  they don’t require you to interview in one specific language  but they do require you to interview in one and stick with it. Here are some guidelines for selecting your language:Choose the language you’re most comfortable with… Can you easily go from problem to solution? As an example  common interview questions asked in Java deal with manipulating a linked list. Ultimately  you shouldn’t let this decide what language you choose  but if you’re struggling to decide  choose the one that will make your life easier. This is partially why some developers choose Python over Java or C++; there’s a lot of extra fluff.

Wrapping upIt’s apparent that probabilistic programming in C# can be tough  especially while using the system.random class  as Eric has alluded to.
Python Concurrency: Making sense of asyncio , How to create asynchronous programs in Python 3There are three main elements to creating asynchronous programs in Python: Native coroutines  event loops  and futures. Event loopsThe event loop is a programming construct that waits for events to happen and then dispatches them to an event handler. Running an event loopWith Python 3.7+ the preferred way to run the event loop is to use the asyncio.run() method. The selectors module contains the poll() and the select() APIs that form the secret sauce behind the event loop. What’s nextIf you’d like to dive even deeper into Python concurrency  you can check out Python Concurrency for Senior Engineering Interviews.

Pods  services  deployments... what do I use when? , I want to deploy 4 of my pod x  this time I would create a replica set. A replica set has a defined number of pods that needs to be running  in this case 4. DeploymentsSo  we have learnt about pods  services  replica sets  and  now the last piece of the puzzle: deployments. As you do in a replica set  you specify the number of pods you would like to run. The other thing to remember is that deployments control replica sets and replica sets control pods; this means that when you use a deployment resource type  you can’t forget that you still need a service to access it.
Understand JavaScript Currying in 7 Minutes , We’ll cover:Master Functional ProgrammingLearn functional programming with hands-on practice. The definition of currying is:Currying turns multi-argument functions into unary (single argument) functions. In other words  In other words  the function takes the first argument and returns a new function. This new function takes the second argument and returns a new function which then takes the third argument. Currying is helpful for functional programming as it allows a short hand syntax for this common functional procedure.

Machine learning education: university vs. online , The theory/practice disconnectDespite schools offering many practical software engineering  UI/UX design  and even data analytics courses  most university machine learning courses remain theoretical  especially courses concerning deep learning topics. Considering data preprocessing  feature engineering  and efficient model deployment make up a majority of a machine learning engineer’s time  this is a painful oversight when it comes to preparing students for industry machine learning. Finally  the most obvious flaw to using university courses to prepare for industry machine learning is inaccessibility. However  at the end of the day  most deep learning MOOCs are still just university classes converted to an online delivery medium. Allen’s takeawaysIt is undeniable that university courses and MOOCs teach significant machine learning content.
My experience working with ML at Google and Microsoft , ML at MicrosoftAt Microsoft  I worked in the specific subdivision of the company focused on CS and AI research  known as Microsoft Research (MSR). MSR is pretty different from other divisions of Microsoft  since the people working at MSR are almost exclusively researchers with PhDs.

The signature of the length() method is as follows:Public int length()The return type of the length() method is int.
The insider's guide to algorithm interview questions , Measuring efficiencyEach of these algorithms has a different efficiency. You’ll often be asked to find the efficiency or “complexity” an algorithm you wrote or to improve one given to you. Complexity is an approximate measure of the efficiency of an algorithm and is associated with every algorithm you write. Time complexity and space complexity are essentially approximations of how much time and how much space an algorithm will take to process certain inputs respectively. Typically  there are three tiers to solve for:Best case — represented as Big Omega or Ω ( n ) (n) ( n )Average case — represented as Big Theta or Θ ( n ) (n) ( n )Worst case — represented as Big O Notation or O ( n ) O(n) O ( n )Big O is preferred to analyze an algorithm  as average and best cases do not give insight to the efficiency of an algorithm for most use-cases.
Coding Bootcamp vs. Computer Science Degree , The average in-state tuition at a public university for a 4-year degree is $9 716 per year and $21 629 per year for out-of-state students. The cost of a Computer Science degree (including living costs) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology is $53 450 per year  $75 275 at the University of Southern California  and $70 094 at Carnegie Mellon – which is the most sought-after university for computer science degrees. BootcampsIn contrast  Coding Bootcamps cost an average of $11 900 for an average of a mere 14.3 weeks. This means that potential developers are getting coding skills in a much shorter time-frame for a fraction of the cost. UniversitiesCS degrees cover the following areas: Programming and Computer Science Fundamentals  Computing Principles  Advanced Mathematics  Algorithms  Computer Systems  and more (data from Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science).
The insider's guide to recursion interview questions , Here  we have the recursive function which contains two parts; the base case and the recursive case. The base case of the function is being defined in line 5 where the function will terminate and return n when the if condition of n<=1 is met. In other terms  the base case is what terminates your program. The recursive case comes next  or the function that we want to repeat until we have reached the base case. So the interviewer asks  “how would you optimize this algorithm?” One way to do it would be through recursion seeing as you only have two variables ( fibonacci n-1 ) and ( fibonacci n-2 ).
How and why to become a machine learning engineer , There is such a large interest in the machine learning industry we thought it was time to talk to some experts in the field. AdaptiLab (Techstars Seattle ‘19) is a B2B startup solving the biggest problems in the machine learning and data science talent pipeline.

The 3 most used stacks are:LAMP StackLinuxApachemSQLPHPMEAN StackMongoDBExpressAngular.jsNode.jsMERN StackMongoDBExpressReactNode.jsAll stacks use JavaScript in some facet  meaning it’s a must-have for any aspiring full-stack developer.
Why you should learn C , It was the first general-purpose programming language to have an extensive user base and libraries. Even if you specialize in a different programming language  you most likely know a lot about C. It has been described as the “lingua franca” of programming languages. Python (a fully object-oriented high-level programming language) is based on C. Almost all abstract languages are still C  deep down. There’s a reason why C is often the first language you learn when you’re getting your CS degree. This means that C knowledge opens the possibility to work on any product.
The 7 most important software design patterns , Design Patterns can be incredibly useful if used in the right situations and for the right reasons. Design Patterns have become an object of some controversy in the programming world in recent times  largely due to their perceived overuse. Code with too many different design patterns is difficult to read or debug. The best way to avoid problems with design patterns is to learn how and why to use each pattern. To help you  let’s explore the top 7 design patterns:
Quick guide to the C++ standard library , With a lot of attention focused on newer object-oriented languages like Python  you might not think C++ is used for much any more. The truth is C++ is still in demand by top tech companies across the world. Employers are specifically interested in applicants with a strong understanding of optimization through the standard library. Today  we’ll walk through what the standard library can do for you and some top library components to use in your next project. Here’s what we’ll cover today:
Build an app from scratch with Vue.js , It’s hard to keep up with all the new JavaScript libraries and frameworks out there. Ideally  JavaScript developers would want to learn them all. But each option has its own prerequisites for jumping in and using them immediately. And some frameworks are appropriate for specified types of work. What’s an option that requires no sharp learning curve  and can be picked up within a few hours?
Java Multithreading & Concurrency: Cracking senior interviews , If you’re looking to make it as a Senior Software Engineer  you’re probably aware of how important Concurrency concepts can be.

Understanding Redux: Beginner's guide to modern state management , Redux is a lightweight state management tool for JavaScript applications  released in 2015 and created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark. Ensure the application state is read-only and requires changes to be made by emitting a descriptive action. Educative’s Redux course teaches you how to use Redux with React and javascript so that you can develop powerful web applications. Learn ReduxWith the hooks functionality and Context API incorporated into React  some have questioned whether Redux is still necessary to build a larger react application. It’s also important to note that Context and Redux cannot be compared in the same category  as Redux is decoupled from the UI layer and is a state management system  while Context is not.
Guide to the ultimate candidate experience , Why work with you Values – Include your company values and real employees talking about what these values really mean or tie these values to specific business initiatives. Does your company want to stand out to interview candidates and have a unique interview process? Recruiters can empower candidates before and during the interview  resulting in a much more positive candidate experience. In our interview of tech recruiters  they recommend calling a candidate to reject or extend the offer to the candidate after the onsite interview. A positive candidate experience recognizes and respects the time that candidates put into the process and provides the resources for them to succeed.
Why C++ is a good first language to learn , C++ allows you to learn programming from the ground up. You’ll pick up other languages fasterMost other major programming languages have syntax based on C++. If you get a good grasp of a general-purpose language like C++  you’ll be able to pick up other  more verbose languages like Java  far more easily. Your foundation in C++ syntax will pay off  because C++ helps to understand the logic structure of all programming. It’s actually a lot harder to start with another programming language  and then move to C++.
Why companies need to invest in tech interview prep , Corporate recruiters helping candidates prepare for a technical interview is a pretty controversial topic. It’s a costly cycle when candidate success isn’t factored in. Here’s why organizations should invest in candidate success programs and interview prep as part of the technical hiring process:1. You can interview and prep the right candidates reducing the amount of effort at every phase of the interview process. ConclusionPreparing candidates for the interview is not providing sub-par engineers with the answers and getting them through the interview process.
